[{"content":"I started blogging at college and I used to enjoy it, back then when Blogger was still a thing. Then moved on to Ghost in a proper cloud server. Somewhere along the way I stopped doing it and exchange rate for USD getting worse probably put the final nail on the coffin of my old blog.\nRecently I\u0026rsquo;ve thinking getting back at it and after a few months of procrastination here we are. I\u0026rsquo;m planning to use github pages this time as a test run to see I\u0026rsquo;ll stick to it.\nI\u0026rsquo;m a software engineer by trade but I expect to write about my other interests most of time with maybe some technical post here or there occasionally. That\u0026rsquo;s why I also picked the domain name by the nickname I use and not by my actual name.\nTo be honest it would be a miracle if people who I don\u0026rsquo;t know personally would find and read this blog but I chose to write it in public to incentivise myself to be more articulate. Because if it was just me writing in a notebook or to just keep it in my computer who cares about the actual content right.\n","date":"2025-06-04T21:16:09+09:00","permalink":"/posts/hello-world/","title":"Hello World"}]
