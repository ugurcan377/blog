I started blogging at college and I used to enjoy it, back then when Blogger was still a thing. Then moved on to Ghost in a proper cloud server.
Somewhere along the way I stopped doing it and exchange rate for USD getting worse probably put the final nail on the coffin of my old blog.

Recently I've thinking getting back at it and after a few months of procrastination here we are. I'm planning to use github pages this time as
a test run to see I'll stick to it.

I'm a software engineer by trade but I expect to write about my other interests most of time with maybe some technical post here or there occasionally.
That's why I also picked the domain name by the nickname I use and not by my actual name. 

To be honest it would be a miracle if people who I don't
know personally would find and read this blog but I chose to write it in public to incentivise myself to be more articulate. Because if it was
just me writing in a notebook or to just keep it in my computer who cares about the actual content right.
