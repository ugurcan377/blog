Then moved on to Ghost in a proper cloud server.
Somewhere along the way I stopped doing it and exchange rate for USD getting worse probably put the final nail on the coffin of my old blog.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve thinking getting back at it and after a few months of procrastination here we are. I&amp;rsquo;m planning to use github pages this time as
a test run to see I&amp;rsquo;ll stick to it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m a software engineer by trade but I expect to write about my other interests most of time with maybe some technical post here or there occasionally.
That&amp;rsquo;s why I also picked the domain name by the nickname I use and not by my actual name.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To be honest it would be a miracle if people who I don&amp;rsquo;t
know personally would find and read this blog but I chose to write it in public to incentivise myself to be more articulate. Because if it was
just me writing in a notebook or to just keep it in my computer who cares about the actual content right.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
